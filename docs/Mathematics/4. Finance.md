# Finance

*Inflation* is the increase in the price of goods and services with respect to time. Inflation means that a fixed amount of capital will be able to purchase fewer goods and services as prices increase.

*Depreciation* is the decrease in the value of an asset with respect to time.

The *principal* is the original loan amount that is borrowed.

The *principal portion* of a payment is the portion that reduces the outstanding loan balance (principal).

The *interest portion* is the payment covering the interest charged for that period.

*Amortisation* is a process whereby a loan is repaid through a series of regular payments. In an amortised loan, interest for each period is calculated on the outstanding loan balance, therefore as regular payments reduce the principal, the interest portion of each payment decreases over time, whilst the principal portion increases.

$\boxed{\text{Interest Paid = Total Repayments - Amount Borrowed}}$

>**Note:** This topic is primarily solved using calculators or software tools which allow for the automation of iterative calculations. Regardless, it is important to recognise the meaning of each parameter and their relation to the relevant formulae.

| Variable | Meaning                                |
| -------- | -------------------------------------- |
| N        | Total number of compounding periods    |
| I%       | Interest rate per year (%)             |
| PV       | Present value of the loan/investment   |
| PMT      | Payment per period                     |
| FV       | Future value of loan/investment        |
| P/Y      | Number of payments per year            |
