A numerical *sequence* is an ordered list of numbers which can often be described by a formula or recurrence relation. Each number within the sequence is called a *term*. The general term within a sequence is called the $n^{th}$ term.

A numerical *series* is the sum of a range of terms in a sequence. A *finite series* describes a series which has $n$ terms ($u_1, u_2, u_3, ..., u_n$), and thus also has a finite sum. An *infinite series* describes a series which has infinite terms ($u_1, u_2, u_3, ...$), which can *converge* to a finite sum or *diverge* to infinity.
## Arithmetic Sequences and Series
An arithmetic sequence (sometimes called an arithmetic *progression*) is a sequence where each term differs from the previous term by a constant value, called the *common difference*, typically denoted as $d$.
The general form ($n^{th}$ term) of an arithmetic sequence is given by: $$u_n=u_1+(n-1)d$$
where $u_1$ is the first term, $d$ is the common difference, and $n$ is the term (e.g. for the $5^{th}$ term, $n=5$).
